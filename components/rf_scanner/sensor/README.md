## This sensor component experimental!

and not maintained for the last rf_scanner release. It returns the sensor state as a float (txid.channel).

It is srongly recommended to go with the text_sensor implementation, which returns a complete sensor state as json string.

This code was comitted just as sample for further sensors.
